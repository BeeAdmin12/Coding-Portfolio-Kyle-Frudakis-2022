        My Journey into HTML and More
      </h3>

      <div class="blog-post">
        <h2 class="blog-post-title">Description of Projects</h2>
        <p class="blog-post-meta">April 29, 2020 by <a href="https://www.instagram.com/kylefrudakis/">Kyle Frudakis</a></p>

        <p>These next couple of paragraphs will go a little in depth about each project that I completed during this semester. The process and the outcome are all very important to me.</p>
        <hr>
        <h2>Project 1</h2>
        <p>This project was the very first one that ever had me dealing with HTML. The project itself looks very scrappy but at the time I was really proud of it. Knowing what I know now, I could definetly make it look better. The hardest part for me during this project was trying to get the text to go to the side of the pictures I added in.</p>
        <h2>Project 2</h2>
        <p>After learning what CSS and <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> is, I was able to make a more appealing webpage. With this new knowledge, I took a second attempt at a "About Me" page. It was a bit tough learning how to implement Bootstrap and learn how to stick things together. After a couple hours, I was able to get things to look the way I want them to.</p>
        <h2>Project 3</h2>
        <p>During this project, I used Brackets to edit my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This time around, I was more comfortable using Bootstrap to make my project easier on the eye. My app has been tested on both Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge and work as expected. For this project, I had to touch JavaScript for the first time. To my surprise, It wasn’t hard at all. The language is slightly different from C++ and has it’s on capabilities but with my prior knowledge of C++, I was able to move though things much faster. Since this was my second time using Bootstrap, it wasn’t as time consuming. I did have to refer to my last project when I came up against errors, which cleared things up fast. Overall, this project gave me a good idea of what JavaScript can do for a website and how it can make it more dynamic for the user. </p>
        <h2>Project 4</h2>
        <p>During this project, I had alot of fun, especially with the music. I got the main functionalities from 10.8 of the Zybook we use in class, as instructed. I was able to add a functionality that gave the user the option to use a dark-mode on the website. I was also able to add some music to make the website more likable. A lot of the text was aligned, and I tried to make it look more friendly. I purposely chose not to use Bootstrap on this project because I wanted to see what I could do from scratch. To be honest, it is going to take a lot of work to get to the level of Bootstrap-like websites. This is a learning process so I would like to try to make my websites from my own code every once and a while and see how they compare to Bootstrap selections. </p>
        <h2>Project 5</h2>
        <p>For this project, it was my first-time using PHP. I had some trouble doing some things that I could normally do on another language like python and C++. For example, I wanted to create a function that had the $_POST[“num”] as one of the parameters but I ran into errors, so I gave up on doing that. I was also struggling on how to create a counter. During this process, I learned that the php code would reset after I clicked the submit button. So, when I went to put a loop of some sort into the php scope, I could initially click the submit button but then I could not leave the loop to submit another guess because the code for the button was in the html scope. I just had a hard time on figuring that one out. I tried to decorate my page with my own styles this time instead of using a bootstrap. I want to try out my skills rather than copy and paste something that looks nice. Throughout this project, I can say I learned a lot because this is another angle about web designing that I didn’t know existed. Reading through the Zybook really gave me a better idea of what I’m supposed to do. I still had to watch a couple videos about POST, GET, and SERVER to get a grip on them because the book didn’t take a lot of time explaining them.</p>
        <h2>Project 6</h2>
        <p>I honestly had a lot of fun doing this project. PHP gives me a lot of freedom to do things that I want and after reading the chapters for this assignment, I understood a lot of key ideas like POST and GET. I also feel as if my CSS abilities are getting better as well. I really enjoyed adding the functionality of making sure that the user input a proper zip code. For this assignment, I didn’t use bootstrap because I still want to practice my own skills and understanding of CSS. By doing this, I grew more comfortable with splitting the screen with two div boxes. Brackets was used to edit the code and I had no problem with it this time. One problem that I did run into was forgetting to upload my CSS file to the server. When I didn’t do that, none of my CSS showed up and it took me a couple of minutes to figure it out. This project was probably my favorite project so far because I could practice a lot of things that I’ve already learned and new topics as well.</p>
        <h2>Project 7</h2>
        <p>This project was an expansion of project 6. The only difference was that the user can have the option to enter a username and password so that they can save certain settings that they prefer. It is a small change to the user but it takes a lot of work to actually make it. This project included SQL to make this work. I put a lot of hard work into it so please enjoy!</p>
