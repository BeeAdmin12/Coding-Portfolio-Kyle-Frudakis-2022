        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>My name is Kyle Frudakis! Based off the first picture, you can tell I'm really into soccer. I've been playing soccer all my life and have loved every minute of it. I used to play college soccer at the University of North Florida my freshman year. Even though now I am a student at FAU, I still train constantly to become a professional soccer player. Currently, I am 20 years old. I have two other siblings, one being my younger brother and the other being my older sister. My family recently moved from Florida to New Mexico so I am the only one left here to finish my college education.</p>

        <h2>Travel</h2>
        <p>Besides soccer, I also really enjoy travelling. Soccer has brought me to a lot of places but for business reasons mostly. Over winter break of 2019, I went to New Mexico to visit my family who just recently moved out there. We did tons of hiking and camping during my 3 weeks there. I would definetly go back for the summer to see how the seasons changed the landscape.<br><br>I've also been to many other places such as New York, Bermuda, Cayman Islands, Poland, Germany, France, England and many more! For soccer, I've been to multiple states but never got to really go sight seeing. Regardless, I feel truely blessed to be able to have seen all these great places.</p>

        <h2>One of Many Pets</h2>
        <p>My family has always had a pet in the house for as long as I can rememeber. We've had dogs, lizards, birds, and fish. Sadly, our dogs and fish have all past away but our birds live on! My parents take care of the birds that we have now since I am away at college. They are in charge of 4 cockatiels and even though it sounds like a lot, they are a lot of fun to have. With me now, I have a bearded dragon. I bought her a couple of weeks after I arrived to FAU and it's been a blast to see her grow over the past couple of months. I wouldn't trade her for anything in the world. her name is Blaze but I tend to called her Un-baby. She always seems to be smiling and her pattern is very bright! Sometimes, taking care of her can be expensive with having to buy bigger tanks, new lightbulbs, constant food, clean sand, and a bunch of other things but I truely find it worth it.</p>

        <h2>Aspirations</h2>
        <p>Just like everybody else, I have goals that I strive to achieve everyday. My biggest goal is to become a professional soccer player. There's only a certain time frame in life where you have the physical ability to play high level sports and thats around the age of 18 to 30 years of age. Thinking about it in a larger picture, that's not a lot of time in your life if you are expected to live to 80+. I first want to try to become a pro player and if I'm not able to do so, I can fall back on being a cyber security specialist, which is my second aspiration.</p>

I've played in Arizona for Barca Academy, for a team in Denmark, team in Germany, and multiple Academy teams in the U.S. Last year, I played college soccer at UNF before transfering over to FAU.

        <p class="lead">Even though she's just a lizard, I feel like we have this special connection. She wakes up when I wake up, she knows when I'm going to feed her, and she always smiles at me when I baby talk her. The only down side I can really think of is that her bodily waste smells awful. Like, really bad. She runs around my floor and always find the starngest of places to fall asleep. Even though the spots she finds can be kind of dangerous, she's still my angel and I'll always try my best to take care of her.</p>
