        <p>My name is Kyle Frudakis! Based off the first picture, you can already tell I'm <em>really</em> into soccer. I've been playing soccer all my life and have loved every minute of it. I used to play college soccer at the <a href="https://www.unf.edu/">University of North Florida</a> my freshman year of college but now I am a student at FAU. I still train constantly to become a professional soccer player.</p>

        <p>Besides soccer, I also really enjoy <strong>travelling</strong>. Soccer has brought me to a lot of <a href="https://www.topdrawersoccer.com/club-soccer-articles/pro-prospects:-florida-teen-in-germany_aid34793">places</a> but for business reasons mostly. Over winter break of 2019, I went to New Mexico to visit my family. We did tons of hiking and camping my whole 3 weeks there. I would definetly go back for the summer to see how the seasons changed the landscape.</p>
            
        <p>I've been to many places! For vacation, I've been to New Mexico and New York. <br> For Soccer business, I've been to multiple states, Bermuda and other islands. <br> I've also lived in Germany and Denmark for a couple years which was an experience to say the least.</p>
            
        <p>
        There are many places that I still want to go to!

        <p>Another big part of my life is my pet bearded dragon! You can learn more about them <a href="http://www.beardeddragonguide.com/">here</a>. Her hame is <u>Blaze</u> but my girlfriend and I usually just called her Un-baby. We get her a month after our first semeter together at FAU. It may be hard to believe but she really brighten up my room! She always seems to be smiling at me and it's really fun to feed her. Sometimes, taking care of her can be expensive with having to buy bigger tanks, new lightbulbs, and constant food but I think it's worth it when she cudddles up against me for warmth.</p>
